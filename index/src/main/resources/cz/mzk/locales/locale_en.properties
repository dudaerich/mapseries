            <p>\
            Map series can be described as results of extensive mapping, usually initiated by \
            the military or other state institutions. Their characteristic features include the \
            representation of large territories on several scales in the form of a series of separate \
            map sheets with a common layout. Costly cartographic works have usually been continuously \
            updated for many decades, with sheets showing regions of high interest having up tens of editions \
            over the time. On the basis of national map series, further thematic maps were created. \
            In some cases thematic content was added in the form of overprints of the original sheets.\
             </p>\
             <p>\
            The most important map series depicting the Czech territory is the Austrian and later Czechoslovak \
            military mapping and Czechoslovak national map series originating in the second half of the 19th \
            century. Important maps of the neighboring countries, especially the German map series from \
            the time of the Second World War, are also worth mention.

            MapSeries works on three modes. In the first you can select the map you \
            want to see by clicking on the map thumbnail representing the series or \
            choosing from the list. After this selection, the corresponding map series \
            layout is displayed with the available map sheets highlighted. A short description \
            of the selected map work is also located in the sidebar. When you click on one of the \
            highlighted map sheets, available editions of that map sheet are displayed. In addition \
            to the preview and a simple description, you will find there a link to the library catalog \
            and to a digital library.\
